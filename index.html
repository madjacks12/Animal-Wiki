        <h2>Everything about the Capybara</h2>
        <p>The capybara and the lesser capybara belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.</p>
        <p>Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails.[6] Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.[14] Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads. Females are slightly heavier than males.</p>

        <h2>Everything about the Sand Cat</h2>
        <p>The sand cat is a Felis species, a genus within the family Felidae.[1] The French soldier and naturalist Victor Loche first described the sand cat from a specimen found in the area of "Négonça" in the northern Algerian Sahara, and proposed to name the cat in recognition of Jean Auguste Margueritte, who headed the expedition into the Sahara.[4] This holotype specimen appears to have been lost.</p>
        <p>The sand cat is found primarily in both sandy and stony desert and has a wide but apparently disjunct distribution through the deserts of northern Africa and southwest and central Asia.[14] It prefers flat or undulating terrain with sparse vegetation, avoids bare sand dunes, where there is relatively little food. It can survive in temperatures ranging from −5 °C (23 °F) to 52 °C (126 °F) and retreats into burrows during extreme conditions. Although it will drink when water is available, it is able to survive for months on the body fluids in its prey.</p>

        <h2>Everything about the Spider-tailed Horned Viper</h2>
        <p>The spider-tailed horned viper (Pseudocerastes urarachnoides) is a species of viper endemic to western Iran which was described in 2006. The head looks very similar to that of other Pseudocerastes species in the region but it has a unique tail that has a bulb-like end and bordered by long drooping scales that give it the appearance of a spider. The tail tip is waved around and used to lure insectivorous birds to within striking range.</p>
        <p>Like other vipers in the genus Pseudocerastes the scales above the eyes rise up to give a horned appearance. A specimen had been collected in 1968 as part of the Second Street Expedition to Iran and deposited in the Field Museum of Natural History at Chicago, identified as Pseudocerastes persicus. It was however found to be distinct and described as a new species in 2006. The species is distinguished by a number of characters.</p>
